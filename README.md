# Hi there, I'm Ainsley! :wave:

Sometimes I like to develop random applications and figured this might be a good place to store and keep track of them all.

### ✏️ About me

```javascript
const Ainsley = {
    pronouns: "He" | "Him",
    code: ["Kotlin", "Java", "PHP", "MYSQL"],
    askMeAbout: ["software development", "app development", "application design"],
    },
    currentFocus: "Android app development",
    funFact: "Bugs were NOT named after an actual bug"
};
```
